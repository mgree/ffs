The pallor was relieved by a pair of huge eyes and fresh red lips that looked as though they would eat you.<p>In the village they called her the She-Wolf because, no matter what she had, she was never satisfied.  The woman crossed themselves whenever they saw her coming, lone as a stray bitch, with the restless and wary appearance of a starving wolf.  She would gobble up their sons and their husbands in the twinkling of an eye with those red lips of hers, and draw them to the tail of her skirt and transfix them with those devilish eyes, as though they were standing before the altar at St Agrippina's.  Luckily the She-Wolf herself never set foot inside the church, either at Easter or at Christmas or to hear Mass or to go to confession.  Father Angiolino of St Mary of Jesus, a true servant of God, had lost his soul on her account.Maricchia, poor girl, a good and worthy soul, shed tears in secret because she was the She-Wolf's daughter and nobody would ever want to marry her, even though she too had a fine trousseau tucked away in a chest and a patch of decent land in the sun, like any other girl in the village.<p>Then it happened that the She-Wolf fell in love with a handsome young fellow back from the army, when the two of them were hay-making on the notary's farm.  She'd fallen for him lock, stock and barrel, her flesh burning beneath her thick cotton bodice, and, staring into his eyes, she was overcome with the kind of thirst you would experience down in the valley on a hot midsummer day.  But he just kept scything calmly away, head down over the hay, saying \"What's the matter, Pina?\".  In the vast expansive fields, where all you could hear was the chirping of the crickets as they leapt, with the sun beating straight down, the She-Wolf tied up sheaf after sheaf, bundle after bundle, showing no sign of fatigue, never looking up for an instant, never putting her lips to the flask, just so long as she could be there behind Nanni, while he scythed away, asking her every so often, \"What is it you want, Pina?\".<p>One evening she told him, while the men, exhausted from their day's labours, were nodding off to sleep in the barn, and the dogs were filling the dark air of the countryside with their howling, \"It's you I want! You that are beautiful as the sun, and sweet as the honey!  I want you!\".<p>\"It's the unmarried daughter of yours that I want,\" Nanni replied, laughing.The She-Wolf thrust her hands into her hair, tearing at the sides of her head without uttering a word, then strode off and stayed away from the barn.  But then the olive-crushing season came round in October, she set her eyes on Nanni again because he was working next door to were she lived, and the creaking of the press kept her awake the whole night long.<p>\"Pick up that sack of olives,\" she said to her daughter, \"and come with me.\"Nanni was pushing the olives under the mill wheel with his shovel, and shouting \"Gee up there!\" to the mule to keep it moving.<p> \"Do you want my daughter Marricchia?\" Pina asked.<p>\"What are you going to give her?\" Nanni replied.<p>\"She's got the things her father left, and she can have my house into the bargain.  All you need to leave me is the corner of the kitchen to spread out my palliasse.\"<p>\"In that case we can talk it over at Christmas.\" said Nanni.<p>Nanni was covered in grease sweat from the oil and the fermenting olives, and Maricchia wanted nothing whatever to do with him, but when they got home her mother grabbed her by the hair and said to her through clenched teeth:\"If you don't take him, I'll kill you!\".You would have thought the She-Wolf was ill, and people were saying that when the Devil grows old he goes into hiding.  She never wandered about the village any more, she didn't stand on the doorstep flashing those crazy eyes of hers.  Her son-in-law, whenever she fixed those eyes on him, began to laugh, and pulled out his scapular to bless himself with.  Maracchia stayed at home, breastfeeding the children, while her mother went off to the fields to work alongside the men; just like a man, in fact, digging, hoeing, rounding up the cattle, and pruning the vines in all weather, in January with an icy wind from the east, or August with the sirocco from the south, when at the end of the day the mules would be drooping their heads and the men would be sitting asleep, propped against the wall with their mouths hanging open.  'In hours that run from dusk till dawn goes no good  woman ever born,' and Pina was the only living soul you could see out and about, picking her way over the boundless fields that stretched into the heat haze of the far distance towards Etna, shrouded in mist, where the sky bore down on the horizon.\"Wake up!\" said the She-Wolf to Nanni, who was lying asleep in the ditch under the dust-laden hedgerow, resting his head between his arms.  \"Wake up, I've brought you some wine to wet your throat.\"<p>Nanni opened his eyes wide, stupefied, still half-asleep, to find her standing over him, white-faced, thrusting her breast towards him and fixing him with her coal-black eyes, and he stretched out his hands, groping the air.<p>\"No! No good woman's abroad from dusk till dawn!\" bewailed Nanni, pressing his face down again into the dry grass of the ditch as hard as he could, with his fingernails tearing at his hair.  \"Go away! Go away!  Keep away from the barn!\"<p>She did go away, did the She-Wolf, tying up her splendid tresses as she went, staring ahead of her toward the hot fields of stubble with her coal-black eyes.<p>But she kept going back to the barn, and Nanni said nothing.  In fact, whenever she was late arriving, in the hours that run from dusk till dawn, he would go and wait for her at the top of the ashen-white, deserted lane, with beads of sweat standing out on his forehead.  And afterwards he would thrust his hands through his hair and repeat every time, \"Go away! Go away! Don't come back to the barn!\"<p>Maracchia wept day and night, and stared at her mother with tear-filled eyes aflame with jealousy, looking like a wolf-cub herself, every time she saw her returning pale and silent from the fields.<p>\"You wicked slut!\" she cried.  \"You wicked slut of a mother!\"<p> \"Shut up!\"<p>\"You thief! Thief!\"<p>\"Shut up!\"<p>\"'I'll tell the police sergeant, that's what I'll do!\"<p>\"Go ahead and tell him!\"<p>She did go ahead, with her children clinging round her neck, totally unafraid, and without shedding a tear.  She was like a mad woman, because now she too loved the husband they had forced upon her, all greasy and covered in sweat from the fermenting olives.The sergeant had Nanni called in, and threatened him with prison and the gallows.  Nanni stood there sobbing and tearing his hair.  He denied nothing, and didn't even try to make excuses.\"I was tempted!\" he cried.  \"I was tempted by the Devil!\"<p>He threw himself at the sergeant's feet, pleading with him to send him to prison.<p>\"For pity's sake, sergeant, take me out of this hell on earth!  Have me killed, send me to prison, never let me set eyes on her again, ever!\"<p>But when the sergeant spoke to the She-Wolf, she replied, \"No! I kept a corner of the kitchen to sleep in, when I gave him my house as a dowry.  The house is mine.  I don't intend to leave it.\"Shortly after that, Nanni was kicked in the chest by a mule, and was at death's door.  But the parish priest refused to bring him the bread of Christ until the She-Wolf left the house.  The She-Wolf went away, and her son-in-law could then prepare to take his leave of the world as a good Christian.  He confessed and made communion with such an obvious show of repentance and contrition that all the neighbours and onlookers were in tears at the bed of the dying man.  And it would have been better if he had died then and there, before the Devil returned to tempt  him and to take him over body and soul as soon as he recovered.<p>\"Leave me alone!\" he said to the She-Wolf.  \"For God's sake, leave me in peace!  I stared death in the face! The poor Maricchia is in despair!  The whole village knows all about it!  It's better for both of us if I don't see you. . . .\"<p>He would have liked to tear out his eyes so as not to see the eyes of the She-Wolf, who made him surrender body and soul when she fixed them upon him.  He no longer knew what to do to release himself from her spell.  He paid for Masses for the souls in Purgatory, and asked the parish priest and the sergeant to help him.  At Easter he went to confession, and did penance in public by crawling on his belly for six feet over the cobblestones in front of the church.  After all that, when the She-Wolf returned to torment him, he said to her:<p>\"Listen!  Just you stay away from the barn, because if you come looking for me again, I swear to God I'll kill you!\"<p>\"Go ahead and kill me,\" replied the She-Wolf.  \"It doesn't worry me.  I can't live without you.\"<p>When he saw her coming in the distance, through the sown fields, he stopped digging at the vine with his mattock, and went and wrenched the axe from the elm.  The She-Wolf saw him coming, pale with frenzy, the axe glittering in the sun, but she never stopped for a moment or lowered her gaze  as she carried on walking towards him, with her hands full of bunches of red poppies, devouring him with her coal-black eyes. \"Ah!\" Nanni stammered.  \"May your soul roast in Hell!\"</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","flapcopy":"The stories of Giovanni Verga (1840-1922) are wonderful evocations of ordinary Italian life, focusing in particular on his native Sicily.

A handful of islanders gather in the small aft cabin, warming themselves by the tiny black stove, while their groceries and shopping bags chill on the deck alongside rows of propane tanks and other large island-bound parcels. Mailbags rest in the starboard cubbyhole, protected from the elements, which can be extremely assertive during the fourteen-mile crossing from the mainland. From November to April, the Laura B. is the only link to the mainland for Monhegan's sixty year-round residents, making the round-trip journey from the tiny fishing town of Port Clyde only three times a week.<p>But on this last day of November, the Laura B. is packed with people. There are nearly as many people on board as live on the island this time of year, most of them mainlanders on their way out to help friends and family prepare for the most important day of Monhegan's year. Tomorrow, December 1, is Trap Day, the day Monhegan's lobstermen begin their unique, winter- only lobster season.</p><p>At a time of year when most of Maine's seven thousand lobster- men have hauled up their traps and brought their boats around to secure winter anchorages, Monhegan's fourteen lobstermen are getting ready to set their traps for the first time since spring. Once the fishermen have set their traps, they'll continue fishing through the dead of winter, braving ferocious weather and subzero temperatures that often leave their twenty-eight- to forty- foot boats encased in frozen spray. The lobstermen can handle this with the help of a sternman or two, but on Trap Day they need all the help they can get moving their heavy traps down to the town wharf. There are only twenty aging, beat-up pickups on the island, but each lobsterman needs to get a gang of six hundred traps, weighted metal cages weighing forty to fifty pounds apiece, out of their backyard, down the hill, and stacked up on the town wharf where they can be loaded onto the lobster boat. It can't be done much beforehand because the island's 8,400 traps can't fit on the granite wharf. Even if they did fit, they'd make offloading the Laura B. next to impossible. So, just before Trap Day, the entire village and dozens of mainlanders turn out to move the traps in the maritime equivalent of a barn-raising ceremony.</p><p>I'm on my way out to help Zoe Zanidakis, the island's only female lobster boat captain and onetime proprietor of the Monhegan House, one of the island's three summer inns. But there's a problem. About two months ago, Zoe quit answering her phone. She stopped picking up her cell phone and left e-mail and answering machine messages unreturned. It was as if Zoe had dropped off the face of the earth. After failing to track her down through several mutual acquaintances&mdash; nobody seemed to know where she was&mdash;I decided to board Laura B. as planned and track her down on the island. After all, no Monhegan lobsterman would ever miss Trap Day, least of all a ninth-generation islander like Zoe. Monhegan lobstermen make or break their season in the first few weeks of December, harvesting lobsters in an area that has not been fished in six months. But Trap Day has a ritualistic importance that transcends dollars and cents. &ldquo;It's like cleaning the slate,&rdquo; one islander explained to me. &ldquo;We all come together to get the boats ready and any of the crap and hard feelings that have accumulated in the community are wiped away.&rdquo; As we pass Allen Island and begin the final, seven-mile open ocean crossing, I'm certain Zoe is out there on the gray, humplike shape looming on the horizon.</p><p>It's a mild day for Maine in early winter&mdash;forty-five degrees and almost sunny, with still air and gently swelling seas&mdash;so many of the passengers spread out on deck, lounging amid the luggage, propane, and building supplies. I join them, and halfway up the port rail I find Billy Payne, who runs one of the island's two small stores. Billy, tanned from a vacation in South Carolina, tells me Zoe is nowhere to be found. &ldquo;They say she's in a movie out in Hollywood,&rdquo; he says, breaking into an understated smile. &ldquo;But nobody seems to know for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>The Laura B. lolls along, unperturbed by the swells. She's nearly sixty years old, and her wooden hull is only sixty-five feet long, but she was built for tougher chores than the Monhegan mail run: running soldiers and ammunition around Pacific bases during the Second World War. Slowly, steadily, Monhegan grows before us, its features becoming more detailed with each passing minute. First the rocky cliffs emerge from their forested crown. Then the forest reveals its inner anatomy of pine, spruce, and fir trees, straight and tall on the island's interior, stunted or dead along the exposed headlands. Guillemots and other cold-loving seabirds flutter over the primeval scene.</p><p>At first only one or two houses are apparent, poking out from the forest like lost children, along with the lighthouse tower, which sticks up from its hilltop like a ship's funnel. But as we round the island's northern tip and head down the western shore, the village slowly reveals itself. A cluster of wood-shingled houses, fish houses, and boat sheds stand on the gentle hillsides facing the shore. There are two hundred all told, but as we approach the harbor it's clear that most of the buildings are boarded up for the winter.</p><p>We slip past the nasty ledges guarding the north entrance and into the harbor, or what passes for one. Monhegan, a sausage-shaped island two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, doesn't have a single deepwater cove or inlet in which one can protect so much as a skiff. All it has is Manana, a small grass-covered hump of rock that protrudes from the sea alongside Monhegan like a whale calf cuddling next to its mother. Monhegan's lobster boats are moored in the narrow passage between the two islands, an anchorage as uncomfortable as it is beautiful. The four-hundred-yard-wide passage is well protected by the tall islands on either side, and the ledges at the narrow north entrance afford reasonable cover from northeasterly winds. But the harbor is completely open to the south, and in a southwesterly storm the seas race through the harbor unimpeded. During particularly fierce winter storms, waves have crashed through low-lying parts of the village, but the lobster boats themselves ride the tempests out on their heavy moorings. We enter the harbor and come alongside the town's heavy granite wharf. Stacks of lobster traps are already growing at the base of the wharf, and one of the town's aging pickups is driving down the dirt road, piled high with more traps to be unloaded. But as we tie up and begin collecting our bags from their pile on the foredeck, the first thing I notice is the camera crew.</p><p>The three-man crew has set up a tripod-mounted camera and a big pole-mounted mike right on the edge of the wharf to film the mail boat's arrival. The height of the tide is such that the camera is pointed right in our faces, and a couple of people pause to stare at it as we head down the gangway. &ldquo;Just move along,&rdquo; one of the cameramen barks, waving us along with a gloved hand. &ldquo;Pretend we're not here.&rdquo; I try but just up the hill from the wharf I encounter a giant boom crane, poised to capture Trap Day action on the wharf. As I stand, gaping, the pickup pulls alongside me.</p><p>I drop my bags and start stacking lobster traps.</p><p>A burly, red-faced man in a flannel shirt has climbed to the top of the truckload of traps, stacked six-high in the same inverted ziggurat pattern farmers use for hay bales, which makes sense since the traps are approximately the same size and weight as a large hay bale. He passes traps down to the four of us on the ground and we carry them, in turn, to the growing stack on the wharf belonging to that particular fisherman. It's not hard to tell which traps go with which stack. Each lobsterman has already rigged his traps, and every second or third trap has a buoy and a coil of rope inside. The distinctive main buoys are painted in the unique color pattern of their owner, in this case white with an orange top and matching orange and white spindle. Later, when the traps are deployed and the buoys are floating on the surface, there will be no confusion as to whose traps are whose. It quickly becomes evident to me that the traps with the buoys in them are much heavier than the others. These &ldquo;headers&rdquo; are the first to be hauled up in the strings of two or three traps used on the island. Often these are more heavily weighted than the other traps in their string, serving as the anchor for the other traps they are attached to, called &ldquo;tailers.&rdquo;</p><p>The truck is empty, and the four people who came down with it jump in the back and start riding up the hill for another load. We haven't yet spoken a word apart from &ldquo;got it&rdquo; or &ldquo;over there.&rdquo; Another truck rolls in, loaded with traps containing fluorescent pink buoys topped with a black ring. The scene repeats itself. By the time the Laura B.'s crew has finished hoisting the heavy cargo onto the wharf with the boat's gantry crane, truckloads of traps are already waiting to be piled up in her landing zone. After an hour or so, the same trucks begin reappearing with fresh loads of traps. The men and women in the respective crews start acknowledging my existence the second or third time around. We shake our introductions with gloved hands. One couple is from Port Clyde and attended Georges Valley High School at the same time I was at a track and basketball rival a few hours to the northwest. Another guy turns out to be from Boothbay and knows my father. As we stack traps I ask if anyone's seen Zoe. I get all sorts of answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Out to help Zoe? Haven't seen her since October,&rdquo; a taciturn sternman tells me. &ldquo;They say she's doing stunt work out in California.&rdquo; A middle-aged resident assures me she's acting in her own movie and that that's why the film crew is here, sleeping in Zoe's house at the top of the hill. &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; a third islander asserts. &ldquo;She's in Australia with that actor Russell Crowe.&rdquo; After hearing variations of these and other stories throughout the day, I feel like I've stepped into a novel cowritten by the ghosts of Franz Kafka and the Bront&euml; sisters.</p><p>After a teal and white truck comes down to the wharf for the third time, the driver introduces himself. He turns out to be my host, John Murdock, a lobsterman in his mid-forties who also runs one of two year-round bed and breakfasts on the island. &ldquo;Colin!&rdquo; John laughs. &ldquo;Was wondering where you were. Welcome to Monhegan! When we get this unloaded, toss your bags in and we'll show you your room.&rdquo; Fifteen minutes later I'm in the back, bouncing up the hill with a couple of John's friends.</p><p>We pass the imposing Island Inn, its windows boarded up for the winter and a film crew on the lawn, round a corner at the crossroads, and pull up in front of John's rambling house. John's wife, Winnie, shows me to my room, where I dump my bags and change footwear before heading around back to where John's traps have been stacked all summer, waiting for this day. A second stack belongs to his nineteen-year-old son, Ben, who has his own friends out on the island helping. But Ben has been distracted by a problem with his boat's engine, and most of his six hundred traps are still sitting in the backyard. Half of John's stack has already been moved down to the wharf.</p><p>By early evening, the wharf is stacked so high with traps that no more can be safely added. A narrow passage to the wharf's boat ramp passes between the fifteen-foot-high towers of green-, black-, or yellow-coated metal traps. A few boats come alongside and take on twenty or thirty traps for the first run, scheduled for the following morning. After that, the wharf grows quiet as most islanders turn in early in preparation for the manic day ahead.<br><br><i>s</i><br><br>The next morning I awaken to the news that Trap Day, like so many Maine winter events, has been postponed by Mother Nature. It had been blowing at thirty miles an hour from the southwest for much of the night. It was quiet now, but the wind had driven a heavy swell into the unprotected mouth of the harbor that would make loading traps from the wharf more difficult than it was worth. Monhegan's lobstermen, who make all-important decisions collectively down at the Stanley fish house, had decided to hold off for a few hours. They were meeting again at eleven to decide if they would go out in the afternoon.</p><p>It's an unseasonably warm fifty-five degrees, and the road down to the wharf is turning muddy, with pools of water accumulating in the ruts left by the town's little fleet of trucks. All that warm air hanging over the forty-degree water has created another hazard. A pea soup fog is flowing slowly over the village, whose clapboard houses drift in and out of the gray mist. Despite the towering piles of traps, I can't see the wharf until I'm almost standing on it. Inside the traps, the fluorescent paint on the buoys glows as it refracts in the swirling fog. I walk through the narrow canyon between the traps and peer out to sea. I see only two of the fourteen lobster boats in the harbor, their sterns piled high with traps. Manana, just two hundred yards away, is completely invisible, though the foghorn on her far side cries out plaintively from time to time. Big swells crash into the wharf's granite blocks every few seconds, and their splash sizzles on the ocean surface like bacon in a frying pan.</p><p>There's no breakfast place on Monhegan this time of year, but there's fresh coffee down at Billy Payne's store. Billy isn't there when I come in, but he's left a pad of receipts on the counter for patrons to fill out. Some have weighted theirs down with little piles of change and banknotes. Rita White, an elderly lady who once managed not to visit the mainland for seven years, is playing solitaire at one of the store's little booths, and a couple of lobstermen are shooting the shit by the coffee thermoses. Somebody's collie is napping on the floor. I greet people good morning, which seems to take everyone but the dog aback, as if they have gotten out of practice since the summer people went away. Rita sizes me up at a glance. As is often the case in Maine, I'm not sure if I've passed inspection, but she nods assent to my sitting opposite her to drink my coffee.</p><p>The lobstermen are speculating on the result of the upcoming fish house meeting, and there's general agreement that the swells won't die down before nightfall. Problem is, tomorrow is Sunday, and a few of the captains observe the Lord's day of rest. Traditionally, Monheganers don't start their season until everyone is ready. If somebody has engine trouble or a sick relative ashore, fishing is postponed until they can start too. But a number of years back, the fishermen by the coffee thermoses recall, the majority decided to start the season on a Sunday, and some of the older fishermen watched them leave from the beach. &ldquo;Didn't do relations much good on the harbor for a time,&rdquo; one recalls.</p><p>As if on cue, pastor Ted Hoskins comes into the store. Hoskins, middle aged with a white sea captain's beard, is the minister of the Maine Sea Coast Missionary Society, a century-old organization that provides social services to Maine's fourteen year-round island communities, none of which have a resident cleric. The Harvard-educated son of Isle au Haut's summer minister, Hoskins usually makes the rounds to his far-flung flock on the Sunbeam V. He conducts weddings and funerals or just talks to islanders who, by midwinter, are getting tired of talking with one another. This weekend, however, Hoskins is on Monhegan to bless the fleet. So is fishing on Sunday taboo? I ask. &ldquo;Oh, gosh, it depends on who you talk to.&rdquo; Hoskins laughs. &ldquo;Some think it brings bad luck. But of course there are all sorts of things that fishermen say can bring bad luck.&rdquo; There's wearing blue clothing on the boat, some say, or carrying black bags. Others say you should never whistle (it calls the wind) or say the word &ldquo;pig,&rdquo; which apparently dooms one's boat, as does setting down a hatch cover upside down. &ldquo;Rest assured,&rdquo; one of the lobstermen by the thermoses pipes up, &ldquo;if we go out, then the next time something breaks they'll say it was because we set out on Sunday, no matter how long from now that is.&rdquo; Everyone has a laugh about that.</p><p>The talk turns inevitably to lobstering and, before too long, to Zoe Zanidakis's mysterious absence. One lobsterman asserts that Zoe is definitely in California, working on her own movie. The film crew here on the island, he maintains, were probably part of the production and, in any case, were quickly making themselves unpopular. They should have had the common sense not to film on the dock as the Laura B. came in, he asserts, or to put their boom crane &ldquo;in the way&rdquo; on the hillside. A female fisherman&mdash;they don't like the term &ldquo;fisherwoman&rdquo;&mdash;chimes in that none of it surprises her. &ldquo;Zoe's always wanted to be famous, she just needs to decide what she wants to be famous for,&rdquo; she says, arms akimbo over her rubber overalls. &ldquo;I mean, Linda Greenlaw &#91;of The Hungry Ocean and The Perfect Storm fame&#93; was famous for being a fisherman. Zoe seems to be trying to be famous by not fishing.&rdquo;</p><p>On my way back from the store, the film crew appears out of the fog in front of me, right in the middle of the road, camera trained on my approach. &ldquo;Keep coming! Keep coming!&rdquo; the cameraman directs me, imperiously waving his hand. I ignore them as ordered, passing by their position without a glance. &ldquo;Great,&rdquo; he says, still looking through his view finder in the opposite direction. &ldquo;Call your agent,&rdquo; he quips, his back to me, as he jabs a thumbs-up in my direction with his free hand. The next time I look over my shoulder the crew has vanished in the mists, as if they had been but an apparition.<br><br><i>s</i><br><br>At midday, the island is still wrapped in fog, awaiting word from the Stanleys' fish house.</p><p>Built in the 1780s, more than 170 years after the first Europeans began fishing from here, the fish house is believed to be the oldest structure on Monhegan. Island fishermen have gathered to make important decisions here for a century or more, partly because of its convenient location. The little two-story structure perches on Fish Beach, one of two one-hundred-yard-long stretches of sand on the harbor, where the lobstermen land their skiffs and drag them ashore after a day of fishing. (Nearby &ldquo;Swim Beach,&rdquo; which is protected from the strong tidal currents running through the harbor, is reserved for summer recreation.) But the real reason that the harbor's informal legislature meets here, rather than at some adjacent fish house, is probably because the Stanley clan has owned it for generations. And for much of the last century, it is said, the Stanleys' word was practically law on the island.</p><p>Stanleys were living in Maine long before the American Revolution, and have been on Monhegan since 1883, when William Stanley came here to man the island's lighthouse. He bought the fish house in 1899, and passed it on to his son, Will, a master carpenter who built many of the homes in the village. William's grandson Dwight, however, embraced lobstering, and by the 1940s had such influence over island affairs that he became known as the &ldquo;king of Monhegan,&rdquo; a title occasionally ascribed to his son, Sherman M., who retired in the mid-1990s and now winters in Florida. The time of kings may be over, but Sherman's son Shermie Stanley, who serves as harbormaster, is still regarded as the informal leader of the fishing community. Someday Shermie's son Dwight may take over at the fish house, becoming the sixth generation of Stanleys to do so.</p><p>The lobstermen now gathering at Monhegan's fish house effectively determine when, how, and by whom the ocean bottom for two miles around the island is lobstered. Until very recently, anybody holding a Maine lobster fishing license was eligible to fish anywhere in Maine waters under Maine law. But in reality, each lobstering community controlled and defended its own bit of territory or &ldquo;lobster bottom&rdquo; from would-be interlopers. These traditional methods have proved remarkably effective at conserving the state's lobsters, virtually the only important commercial fish species that has not been fished into near-oblivion.</p><p>Monhegan, whose residents are particularly dependent on lobstering, has a long history of careful, long-term conservation. In 1907, the fish house took the unusual step of asking the legislature to ban lobster fishing within two miles of the island from July to December, initiating the island's unusual winter-only fishery. In Dwight's day, the fish house mobilized to free undersized lobsters from the traps. Doug and Harry Odom, proprietors of the island store at the time, compelled one of their unwilling fellow lobstermen to comply by threatening not to sell him anything. In 1974, when Sherman Stanley and his brother Alfred led the harbor, the island's lobstermen voluntarily imposed a six-hundred-trap limit on themselves when most mainland lobstermen fished twice as many. These conservation measures have kept Monhegan's lobster bottom unusually productive.</p><p>Things don't always go smoothly out on the water, however. From time to time, lobstermen from adjacent harbors get into disputes over where one's territory should begin and the other's end. A growing harbor occasionally tries to bully a shrinking one into ceding territory. Sometimes an aggressive fisherman or two will decide to fish wherever they want to, and woe to anyone who tries to stop them. First, warnings are left: a note left in an interloper's trap, a knot tied around the buoy. After that, things may escalate into full-scale lobster war. Traps are cut&mdash;sometimes hundreds of them in a single day. Sometimes shots are fired, and boats are rammed or sabotaged. It can, in the words of one lobsterman, get &ldquo;really ugly, really fast.&rdquo;</p><p>A few years back, things were getting really ugly in the waters around Monhegan. In the fall of 1995, the mainland town of Friendship, sixteen miles to the northwest, the island's chief rival, launched a full-scale incursion into Monhegan's traditional territory. Much of this territory was not recognized under the 1907 state law, and Friendship, with a winter population nearly twenty times larger than Monhe- gan's, had been &ldquo;pushing the line&rdquo; especially hard since the late 1970s, when bigger, safer boats made it easier to tend traps this far from home. The invasion triggered a vicious lobster war. Traps were cut and, near the end of the season, vandals sank John Murdock's Sea Hag while she sat at her mooring in Port Clyde, causing $13,000 in damage. &ldquo;When they came out here and boats started getting damaged and guns were being toted around, I thought: this is wrong and somebody in the state ought to know about it and ought to help us,&rdquo; recalls Doug Boynton, one of Monhegan's leading lobstermen. &ldquo;We were pushed to the point where we felt if we didn't do something, we would lose our lobster bottom, and that would be the end of the winter community out here.&rdquo;</p><p>Things went from bad to worse. As tempers flared, Department of Marine Resources commissioner Robin Alden tried to negotiate a compromise, but it fell apart after a single season. The dispute had laid bare the gap between the laws of the state and the laws of the fishermen. In the fall of 1997, Karl Pitcher and five other Friendship lobstermen decided to use the state's laws to crack open Monhegan's waters once and for all. Using a loophole in the state's lobster regulations, the Friendship lobstermen attempted to register as legal members of Monhegan's winter-only fishing fleet, even though they kept their boats in Friendship. If the move went forward, it would have represented a 50 percent increase in the number of lobstermen in the Monhegan Island Conservation Zone, more than enough to reduce each islander to a starvation- sized piece of the pie. Or, as Shermie Stanley put it at the time: &ldquo;If ten more people come into your cranberry bog, there's not going to be that many cranberries for you.&rdquo;</p><p>That's when Monhegan's lobstermen met at the fish house and decided to fight the law with the law. Rather than setting their traps in the winter of 1997, they bundled their families into their boats and took their case directly to the Maine state legislature in Augusta. If the laws weren't changed to keep nonislanders out of Monhegan waters, Doug Boynton told anyone who would listen, it would undermine the traditional territories system that had served the lobster industry so well. Harbors that hadn't managed their resource well, he told reporters, shouldn't be allowed &ldquo;to uproot as a posse and raid another area.&rdquo; John Murdock's family camped out in Augusta for much of the winter. His younger son, Kyle, age eight, proved one of the most effective lobbyists, engaging senators in the elevators and paging for members of the house. &ldquo;They basically just moved in,&rdquo; recalls Senator Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset, who championed the islanders' cause. &ldquo;Their absolute commitment to their way of life and the fact that the legislature literally controlled whether or not they survived really made an impression. At a point when we're losing many of the people in small island communities, here was a chance to help one that had done an incredibly good job of taking care of themselves for a long time.&rdquo;</p><p>The effort paid off. In February 1998, the legislature passed a law effectively closing Monhegan's grounds to nonislanders by a staggering margin: 29 to 1 in the Senate and 132 to 14 in the House. On February 27, the islanders piled into the House gallery to watch Governor Angus King sign the unprecedented law. &ldquo;Maine has a long history of recognizing tradition,&rdquo; King said. The legislation, the governor proclaimed, was &ldquo;nothing new&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;a recognition by the Legislature and the governor of something that's been the law for nearly 100 years.&rdquo;</p><p>In the three years since, the island's lobstermen say things have been going well. Tension with Friendship has been reduced, but they fear that's only because the lobstermen there are embroiled in some internal dispute of their own. &ldquo;There's probably just a changing of the guard there now,&rdquo; John Murdock says with a chuckle. &ldquo;Pretty soon the next generation of Monhegan-haters will come along, because they've been raised that way by their family members who hold them up on the shores of Friendship saying, &lsquo;See that island out there? It will all be ours someday!'&rdquo;</p><p>But for now, the island remains in Monhegan hands, and at midday, word comes down from the fish house: given the swell and fog, Monhegan will start its season at 6:30 the following morning.<br><br><i>s</i><br><br>I get up at six the next morning and walk down to the dock. It is still night, but the skies have cleared. The moon, nearly full, casts shadows from the village houses and dances on the gently undulating ocean. There isn't another soul on the wharf, but the lobstermen are already out on their boats, turning on lights, squaring away gear, and moving out to &ldquo;the line&rdquo; at the harbor entrance. There they hover, bathed in moonlight, while Ted Hoskins reads the blessing of the fleet over the marine radio. I've heard that Shermie used to blow his whistle and the fleet would charge out cowboy-style, all hoots and hollers. But when the lobster boat's diesel engines fire up at 6:30, only a few whoops and yee-haws echo across the harbor. Then, red and green running lights twinkling on the water, the boats tear out of the harbor, disappearing around the back of Monhegan and Manana.</p><p>Over the next hour, the wharf changes from a tranquil observation post to a hive of frenzied activity. The whole town has turned out to get the traps down to the dock, onto the boats, and down to the lobster bottom. Trucks trundle up and down the hill with new traps to replenish the great stacks. Boats, sometimes two or three at a time, come up to the dock, and people begin scrambling like pit crews to get them under way. We form bucket brigades, passing traps down from trucks, across the wharf, and down to the lobstermen on the boats below, who stack them in astonishing piles that overhang the aft rail and extend all the way to the cockpit housing. We move countless bait tubs filled with crushed ice and bags of stinky five- to six-inch-long herring. All the while, little Kyle Murdock is issuing orders as he marches across the tops of the trap stacks in his green rubber boots.</p><p>In the early afternoon, people start arriving at the wharf with food for everyone. In between unloading trucks and loading boats, we munch on apples and muffins, fill our cups with coffee from the thermoses, and down slices of hot pizza from the North End Market. While snacking I learn that the film crew has managed to piss off the wrong people and has been told in no uncertain terms that they are not to film on the dock today. Apparently the cameraman got right in the face of some of the lobstermen while they were working on their engine. This was the sort of thing the crew might have been welcome to do had their social standing been higher. A gregarious photographer from Portland's Salt Institute for Documentary Studies, clearly in seventh heaven amid the traps, gained permission to shoot people up close. But under the circumstances, the film crew got a shot of an enraged fisherman, eyes bulging, screaming, &ldquo;Get your fucking camera out of here and don't come back!&rdquo; They had retreated up the hill to their boom and were trying to capture some of the action from there. In Maine, a bad attitude can get you a long way in the wrong direction.</p><p>By four o'clock the sun is setting and the stacks of traps are vanishing like snowbanks in springtime. Doug Boynton is the first to finish, his crew marching off the Alice B. and up the hill like mock heroes. &ldquo;Out of the way,&rdquo; someone jokes. Doug tells me it's been the smoothest Trap Day he's ever seen. An hour later it's nearly dark, but the temperature still hovers at fifty degrees with a clear navy sky and flat calm. We load the thirty traps onto Sea Hag and John Murdock invites me to hop onboard for the last set.</p><p>We head out of the harbor through the north passage. It's that magical twilight time when the fading sky transforms the ocean into a mesmerizing silver-blue kaleidoscope. The bow wave appears almost fluorescent as we power out beyond Manana. Holden Nelson, the new owner of the Monhegan House, helps out by impaling the bags of herring on the long, skewerlike baiting needles used to bait the traps. When John reaches the spot where he wants to deploy the first traps, he throttles us down to a near-stop. Chris, John's sternman, goes back and forth to the stern a couple of times, placing a header, then a footer trap on the starboard rail. Chris flips the doors of the header out and, as we drift forward, throws the buoy and rope out into the water. Holden slips bait into each of the traps, and John ties them together with a type of nylon rope that floats, preventing it from hanging up on the bottom. At John's signal, Chris tosses the header overboard. John guns Sea Hag forward, balancing the tailer on the rail with his spare hand. A few seconds later, the rope linking it to the sinking header trap has played out and John shoves the tailer overboard. A few moments later he slows again and the crew repeats the process. For John, spacing is everything. &ldquo;I want to be able to haul a trap, take the lobster out, bait it, set it back, and as I'm going out and all the ropes are rushing overboard then, within seconds, I'm onto the next one and hauling that in,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;No need to be looking all over the place for your next buoy, especially on rough days when they get harder to find, or when you get older and your eyesight gets a little worse.&rdquo;</p><p>When the last tailer drops overboard we turn back toward the north end of Manana. A gannet, a great white coldwater seabird, soars over the boat, checking us out. In a lifetime in Maine, I've never seen one on our coast, but John says that out here he sees them all the time in the winter. The bird does a little loop and soars off to the southeast and into the fading sky.</p><p>Back in the harbor, as Holden and Chris begin cleaning up, John glances over the moorings, taking attendance. Every lobsterman is accounted for, their boats hanging off their respective moorings and their skiffs rowing toward or already pulled up on the beach in the shadow of the fish house.</p><p>Only one mooring lies conspicuously empty, the one with Equinox painted across its top, the one belonging to Zoe Zanidakis.<br><br><i>s</i><br><br>I'd met Zoe on Monhegan several months earlier, at the height of the summer tourist season. I was researching this book, and a number of acquaintances suggested I speak with her while on Monhegan. In a state where the ties between land and families remain strong, Zoe had rock-solid Monhegan credentials. Her mother's family, the Bracketts, had been on the island for more than a century and had run the Monhegan House for more than seventy years. Zoe, a single mom, grew up on the island, attended its white clapboard one-room school, and raised her son, Ron, here. Like most islanders, she had one foot in the fishery, and one in the summer tourist trade. She'd been lobstering for twelve years, building her way up from an old thirty-foot gasoline-powered lobster boat to the Equinox, a fast, forty-foot Young Brothers diesel. For many summers she'd run the family's inn and restaurant, but the previous winter she'd sold it to Holden and started taking fishing parties out on Equinox, which was specially rigged for the purpose. Now she was promoting a novelty calendar, &ldquo;The Lobsterwomen of Maine,&rdquo; in which she was featured as Miss March. &ldquo;Come on out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll take you fishing.&rdquo;</p><p>The day before our appointed meeting, I caught one of the boats out to Monhegan. In summer, there are plenty to choose from: six round-trip boats a day running to the island from Boothbay, Port Clyde, and New Harbor. The Hardy, a double-decked excursion boat out of New Harbor, was packed with day-trippers, eager to hike out to the hundred-foot-high cliffs on the back side of the island. The crossing was balmy, almost serene. At the dock, the island's trucks were waiting to transfer luggage of short-term guests like myself to the Island Inn, Monhegan House, or Trailing Yew. The infirm could catch a ride in the truck's cab, but everyone else just walked up the hill and down the dirt roads to their given lodgings. The two hundred or so cottages in the village were open for the season, flower boxes hung from the windows, occupants seated in Adirondack chairs on the porches or the fresh green grass on the lawn. In the half-mile walk to Monhegan House, I passed three painters working at their easels capturing, respectively, the grassy hump of Manana, lilies planted along the base of a summer porch, and the weather-beaten profile of an old fish house, recently converted to summer lodgings. I passed a cadaverous-looking Englishman near the entrance to the island's tiny post office and was sure I'd met him before; I later learned this was Eric Clapton, whose elegant sailing yacht Blue Guitar was moored among the lobster boats, the Union Jack ensign hanging from the sternpost. When I reached Monhegan House, my luggage was waiting for me on the porch steps. I carried it in to the reception desk, where Holden Nelson said hello, told me how to get to my room, and promised to check me in later. People came and went through the swinging screen doors, some pausing by the stone fireplace to peek at today's New York Times, which had arrived from the Hardy with my luggage. The restaurant&mdash;one of two on the island&mdash;was gearing up for lunch service, while future patrons passed the time on the rocking chairs out on the porch, watching people walk past on the main road. A truck went by maybe once or twice an hour and traffic noise consisted of conversation and the quiet padding of people's feet.</p><p>In summer, the village seemed crowded. Indeed, the resident population quadruples to around 240 in summer, twice that if hotel guests are added to the tally. In the early afternoon, when the waves of day-trippers reach their crescendo, there can be as many as 1,500 people on the island, enough to tax the tiny community's water supplies and trash collecting abilities. In the height of summer, many residents feel overwhelmed by the tourist onslaught. When some of the boat companies added extra boat trips a few years back, Billy Payne closed his store early and posted a sign on the door protesting the island's &ldquo;population explosion.&rdquo; But others say it's not the sheer numbers that trigger resentment; it's the minority of short-term visitors who can't seem to grasp that they've arrived in a real, living island community. A few think they are coming to a resort like Newport or Nantucket, and arrive at the dock with golf clubs and tennis racquets (there are no facilities for either) or evening wear or high-heeled shoes (which don't mix well with either the dirt roads or the rustic ethos of the established summer community). But the most dull-witted think they're visiting a theme park like Colonial Williamsburg or Disneyland. Monheganers have awakened to find day-trippers wandering around their kitchens and living rooms and have apprehended them picking flowers in the backyard. &ldquo;Where is the T-shirt shop?&rdquo; one such person asked me that summer, and stood agape and confused at the notion that there wasn't such an establishment in the village. In fact, I informed her, apart from Billy Payne's store, the North End Market, and Black Duck&mdash;Barbara Hitchcock and Pam Rollinger's tiny gift shop&mdash;there was no shopping on Monhegan at all. She looked at me in horror and, after a long pause to gather her wits asked, desperation in her voice: &ldquo;Well, why do people come here then?&rdquo;</p><p>The answer, of course, lay all around her. We stood in the center of one of the great anomalies of early-twenty-first-century American life: an ancient, self- governing village, essentially classless and car-less, whose homes, sheds, and footpaths appear to have thrust themselves out of the wild and arrestingly beautiful landscape. There's a deep sense of rootedness on Monhegan unusual in our young, frenetic nation, a sense of knowing where you are, who you are, and where lies the critical fulcrum that balances what is individually possible with what is communally desirable. And it is certainly one of the few places in the world where the scions of great moneyed families are socially and politically outranked by persons who earn their living stuffing rotten herring in nylon bags in an effort to ensnare large bottom-feeding bugs. It is, despite its many problems and challenges, an embodiment of Thomas Jefferson's utopian vision for this country: an egalitarian republic of small, self-sufficient producers, where democracy is practiced directly by the citizens, and aristocratic privilege is unrecognized or unknown. It's an anachronism, to be sure, something better suited to a tiny community on a remote island than to, say, New York City. But being immersed in it pulls at something deep within our civic being, a hint of a simpler, perhaps nobler world that might have been, but can never be again.</p><p>But it was Monhegan's staggering beauty that first attracted outside visitors. As elsewhere on the Maine coast, painters were the first to discover this island's arresting scenery, and over the years many of the major figures of American painting have been drawn here. Stroll around Monhegan and you find yourself walking through one painting after another. There are the fish houses Robert Henri captured on a stormy day in 1903. Nearby Fish Beach is the setting for George Bellows's Cleaning Fish (1913), Eric Hudson's An Island Harbor (1926), and Samuel Triscott's late afternoon Fish Houses and Beach (c. 1910). From the hillside, on a cloudy, snowy winter's day, there's the vista of cottages and Manana that Andrew Winter painted in 1944. Nearby, the great bronze bell that Jamie Wyeth immortalized in Bronze Age stands near the lighthouse, though when he painted it in 1967 it was perched on Manana's grassy southern bluff looking out over the open ocean. Follow the footpath that snakes along the cliffs toward the back side of the island and you'll pass a rounded granite promontory littered with the crushed shells of crabs dropped by the seagulls who captured them; it's the setting for Jamie's Gull Rock. Farther up the shore you'll reach the bold cliffs and headlands that have been painted by Henri and Kent, George Bellows and Edward Hopper, Jamie, Andrew, and N. C. Wyeth. Their paintings attracted other painters and, ultimately, cottagers of all sorts searching for a pastoral setting to while away the summer months.</p><p>It's a scenario that was repeated in communities all along the coast of Maine in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Artists discovered beautiful places and, in painting them, put them on the maps consulted by the East Coast's summering classes. What Henri and Kent did for little Monhegan in the early twentieth century, Thomas Cole and Frederick Church did for mountainous Mount Desert Island in the mid-nineteenth. Fitz Hugh Lane discovered the gentle beauty of Penobscot Bay's outports and islands&mdash;lighthouses perched on rocky points beneath gentle hills. Hopper made the lighthouse at Seguin Island into a subconscious national icon, while Winslow Homer did the same for the rocks of Prout's Neck, near Portland.</p><p>Many of those who saw these paintings wanted to see the places they depicted. Most were wealthy, some shockingly so. In the mid-nineteenth century, they started coming to the Maine coast, staying in boardinghouses and, shortly thereafter, the new resort hotels that sprang up all the way from the sandy beaches of southern Maine to the stark mountains of Mount Desert. These pioneering &ldquo;summer people&rdquo; liked what they found. America was in the midst of the Industrial Age, its cities noisy, polluted, and swelling with immigrants with strange customs, languages, and religions. In coastal Maine, comfortable city dwellers saw a simpler time, when New England was still rural, agrarian, and Protestant. Here they could &ldquo;rusticate,&rdquo; recharging their batteries amid this dreamy world of the recent past, where noble, simple Yankee folk went about their lives, in harmony with their surroundings, God, and one another. And so the &ldquo;Maine Myth&rdquo; was born: a story of a stalwart, self-sufficient place that has somehow dodged the excesses that plague the rest of the country and retained the more connected, humane life that characterized the lost Golden Age of the early American republic. Maine, the state tourism board would later declare, was the way life should be.</p><p>The reality was somewhat different. Like other parts of New England, Maine's few industrial towns were attracting large numbers of immigrants&mdash;Irish and French, Italians and Finns, Ukrainians and Jews. But the summer folk rarely saw these places, most of which were located well inland to harness the power of the state's many rivers. They came instead to the southern beaches or the tiny outports of Maine's central and eastern coast, places that have defined Maine for outsiders since the days of John Smith. And along this coast, the population was surprisingly homogenous; most inhabitants were descended from their community's original seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English and Scotch-Irish settlers. If a summer person visited a Barters or Beal's Island, he or she could count on meeting members of the Barter or Beal clan there. There were Pendletons on Pendleton Point, Dyers on Dyers Neck, and McFarlands on McFarland Shore. Certain families had been on this coast long enough, undisturbed by major immigrations, to have developed an almost European conviction that there was a blood-and-soil link between the people and the land. They were, in large part, Protestant, though the Puritans' old Congregational Church had never had a monopoly on power here as it had for more than a century elsewhere in New England. Though there were plenty of echoes of New England's Puritan past in the design of the town greens and old meeting houses, there was much that didn't jibe with classic Yankeedom. Even the dispersed settlement patterns upon the land and the names of the oldest towns were patterned after places in the English West Country, as opposed to the Puritan strongholds of East Anglia.</p><p>But the greatest misconception&mdash;one that remains today&mdash;is that the coast's people lived in an elevated state of preindustrial simplicity. Few of Maine's summer residents of the late nineteenth century were aware that the coast's economy, once vital, had recently undergone a thorough and devastating collapse. Maine wasn't preindustrial; it had just been deindustrialized.</p><p>A few decades earlier, Maine ice, granite, lumber, salt cod, and foodstuffs filled the docks of the United States' Atlantic ports, themselves clogged with Maine-built sailing ships. But those goods had been displaced by refrigerators and cement, by fresh fish caught by Gloucester steamships and cheap lumber and foodstuffs moved from the Midwest by the nation's railroads. Practically overnight, all of Maine's industries collapsed. As a result, the coast was losing population. The wild meadows and weather-beaten farmhouses the summer people found so picturesque had been abandoned by their owners, thousands of whom had moved to Ohio in hopes of a better life. With the offshore fishing industry in decline, residents of many coastal towns tried to build an industry around the only resource they had left: the summer people themselves.</p>","flapcopy":"<b>&ldquo;A thorough and engaging history of Maine&rsquo;s rocky coast and its tough-minded people.&rdquo;<i>&mdash;Boston Herald</i></b><br><br><b>&ldquo;[A] well-researched and well-written cultural and ecological history of stubborn perseverance.&rdquo;<i>&mdash;USA Today</i></b><br><br>For more than four hundred years the people of coastal Maine have clung to their rocky, wind-swept lands, resisting outsiders&rsquo; attempts to control them while harvesting the astonishing bounty of the Gulf of Maine.

A froth of whitewater rolls onto the wide, sandy strand of Long Beach, where the Pacific Ocean stretches out to meet the horizon.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve seen this view countless times, and it&rsquo;s nothing short of magical. But for me, it means one thing above all: home.<br><br>Just a few minutes farther up the road is the Wickaninnish Inn, the realization of our long-held family dream. Growing up along this wild coast, my parents would talk about opening an inn on the rocks overlooking Chesterman Beach. Our goal was to create a destination that would allow others to discover the remarkable beauty of this part of the world. To have our guests be mesmerized by the rolling waves, meet the fascinating characters we call our neighbours, and revel in the taste of local salmon and crab. We wanted to create a place of quiet serenity right on nature&rsquo;s edge.<br><br>&ldquo;The Wick,&rdquo; as our friends like to call it, has become that place. Today we are a 75-room inn perched on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, with a view of this mighty ocean from every room, suite, and public space. The Inn was the first high-end hotel on the west coast of Vancouver Island and the first destination resort, with all that implies: high-thread-count sheets, attentive service, and a soothing ambience of natural wood, stone, and glass combined with the soft colours of the rainforest. We&rsquo;re honoured to be a member of the Relais &amp; Ch&acirc;teaux family, an international association of intimately scaled luxury properties guided by the five Cs: Calm, Character, Courtesy, Charm, and&mdash;perhaps most importantly&mdash;Cuisine.<br><br>The Pointe Restaurant is the crown jewel of the Wickaninnish Inn. The space is encircled with floor-to-ceiling windows framing a 240-degree panorama of Chesterman Beach, forested offshore islands, and the endless ocean. Inspired by our family cabin on the adjacent point of land, at first glance, the room looks simple: an octagonal space with wooden chairs and tables protected by massive hand-adzed cedar posts and beams fanning out from a central core to the windows and ever-changing vistas beyond. Look closer, though, and you&rsquo;ll see the quiet handcrafted elegance of expertly detailed woodwork and perfectly placed lighting illuminating locally crafted tableware and haunting works by local First Nations artists. We&rsquo;ve done all we can to create everything with care, no detail left to chance.<br><br>But as spectacular as the scenery is, and as elegant as the d&eacute;cor is, the real masterpieces here are on the plates. <br><br>Since opening in 1996, our kitchen has been led by some of Canada&rsquo;s most talented chefs, from our opening chef, Chef Rod Butters, to current Executive Chef Warren Barr. Not only have they prepared delicious meals for our guests, they have also been leaders in the sustainable, seasonal, farm-to-table&mdash;or more accurately on this coast, boat-to-table&mdash;culinary movement. Long before it was fashionable, they were sourcing produce from the Island&rsquo;s fishers, foragers, and farmers. Through their menus, they celebrated the incredible local seafood bounty, including Dungeness crab, salmon, spot prawns, and halibut, as well as treasures of the forest, such as tender chanterelle mushrooms and tart cynamoka berries. They created a style of cuisine unique to this region; they also inspired other chefs who over time have transformed tiny Tofino into one of Canada&rsquo;s great culinary communities.<br><br>In the following pages, we&rsquo;ve gathered some of the most unforgettable dishes created by our chefs, including Chef Butters&rsquo;s shellfish-rich potlatch, a West Coast take on bouillabaisse (page 126); Chef Duncan Ly&rsquo;s Thai-scented chowder (page 60); Chef Andrew Springett&rsquo;s cinnamon-scented duck (page 168); Chef Mark Filatow&rsquo;s bright sidestripe prawn escabeche (page 148); Chef Justin Labossiere&rsquo;s saffron-scented ravioli stuffed with crab (page 144); Executive Chef Barr&rsquo;s crispy briny oyster coals (page 130) and his beautifully sculpted salmon mosaic (page 132); Chef Matthias Conradi&rsquo;s decadent chocolate platter for two (page 199); and Chef Matt Wilson&rsquo;s hearty sourdough bread (page 71). There is salmon in a myriad of dishes, crab in almost as many, and chowder, so much chowder. <br><br>Are you hungry yet?

A froth of whitewater rolls onto the wide, sandy strand of Long Beach, where the Pacific Ocean stretches out to meet the horizon.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve seen this view countless times, and it&rsquo;s nothing short of magical. But for me, it means one thing above all: home.<br><br>Just a few minutes farther up the road is the Wickaninnish Inn, the realization of our long-held family dream. Growing up along this wild coast, my parents would talk about opening an inn on the rocks overlooking Chesterman Beach. Our goal was to create a destination that would allow others to discover the remarkable beauty of this part of the world. To have our guests be mesmerized by the rolling waves, meet the fascinating characters we call our neighbours, and revel in the taste of local salmon and crab. We wanted to create a place of quiet serenity right on nature&rsquo;s edge.<br><br>&ldquo;The Wick,&rdquo; as our friends like to call it, has become that place. Today we are a 75-room inn perched on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, with a view of this mighty ocean from every room, suite, and public space. The Inn was the first high-end hotel on the west coast of Vancouver Island and the first destination resort, with all that implies: high-thread-count sheets, attentive service, and a soothing ambience of natural wood, stone, and glass combined with the soft colours of the rainforest. We&rsquo;re honoured to be a member of the Relais &amp; Ch&acirc;teaux family, an international association of intimately scaled luxury properties guided by the five Cs: Calm, Character, Courtesy, Charm, and&mdash;perhaps most importantly&mdash;Cuisine.<br><br>The Pointe Restaurant is the crown jewel of the Wickaninnish Inn. The space is encircled with floor-to-ceiling windows framing a 240-degree panorama of Chesterman Beach, forested offshore islands, and the endless ocean. Inspired by our family cabin on the adjacent point of land, at first glance, the room looks simple: an octagonal space with wooden chairs and tables protected by massive hand-adzed cedar posts and beams fanning out from a central core to the windows and ever-changing vistas beyond. Look closer, though, and you&rsquo;ll see the quiet handcrafted elegance of expertly detailed woodwork and perfectly placed lighting illuminating locally crafted tableware and haunting works by local First Nations artists. We&rsquo;ve done all we can to create everything with care, no detail left to chance.<br><br>But as spectacular as the scenery is, and as elegant as the d&eacute;cor is, the real masterpieces here are on the plates. <br><br>Since opening in 1996, our kitchen has been led by some of Canada&rsquo;s most talented chefs, from our opening chef, Chef Rod Butters, to current Executive Chef Warren Barr. Not only have they prepared delicious meals for our guests, they have also been leaders in the sustainable, seasonal, farm-to-table&mdash;or more accurately on this coast, boat-to-table&mdash;culinary movement. Long before it was fashionable, they were sourcing produce from the Island&rsquo;s fishers, foragers, and farmers. Through their menus, they celebrated the incredible local seafood bounty, including Dungeness crab, salmon, spot prawns, and halibut, as well as treasures of the forest, such as tender chanterelle mushrooms and tart cynamoka berries. They created a style of cuisine unique to this region; they also inspired other chefs who over time have transformed tiny Tofino into one of Canada&rsquo;s great culinary communities.<br><br>In the following pages, we&rsquo;ve gathered some of the most unforgettable dishes created by our chefs, including Chef Butters&rsquo;s shellfish-rich potlatch, a West Coast take on bouillabaisse (page 126); Chef Duncan Ly&rsquo;s Thai-scented chowder (page 60); Chef Andrew Springett&rsquo;s cinnamon-scented duck (page 168); Chef Mark Filatow&rsquo;s bright sidestripe prawn escabeche (page 148); Chef Justin Labossiere&rsquo;s saffron-scented ravioli stuffed with crab (page 144); Executive Chef Barr&rsquo;s crispy briny oyster coals (page 130) and his beautifully sculpted salmon mosaic (page 132); Chef Matthias Conradi&rsquo;s decadent chocolate platter for two (page 199); and Chef Matt Wilson&rsquo;s hearty sourdough bread (page 71). There is salmon in a myriad of dishes, crab in almost as many, and chowder, so much chowder. <br><br>Are you hungry yet? Well, you&rsquo;re in luck&mdash;all the deliciousness of the Wickaninnish Inn lies just ahead.

At the Link family reunion in Robert&rsquo;s Cove, I counted six versions, all different. The essential ingredients are few, but flavor and texture vary greatly.<br> <br>The main difference between dirty rice and rice dressing is that rice dressing is generally made with ground beef or pork, whereas dirty rice is made with pork and chicken livers. Many people think they don&rsquo;t like liver, but when it&rsquo;s balanced with other flavors, the liver taste is not overpowering.

When the oil is hot, add the pork and chicken livers and cook, stirring, until browned. Add the salt, black pepper, and chili powder and stir often, but resist the impulse to stir constantly: You want the meat to stick to the pan and get crusty. Add &amp;frac14; cup of the chicken broth and cook until it has evaporated, allowing the meat mixture to get browned and crusty and stick to the pan once again. Add the onion, celery, garlic, jalape&ntilde;o, and oregano and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are nicely browned and crusty and beginning to stick to the pan. Add the rice, the remaining 1 &amp;frac14; cups broth, the scallions, and parsley. Stir until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is heated through.<br> <br>NOTE: When making dishes that involve rice, remember that your flavor base will seem overly seasoned until the rice absorbs the flavors. In Cajun cooking, salt is the most crucial ingredient to get right, so you&rsquo;ll want to taste the dish after the rice cooks and adjust accordingly.","flapcopy":"An untamed region teeming with snakes, alligators, and snapping turtles, with sausage and cracklins sold at every gas station, Cajun Country is a world unto itself.

I pegged ole Norma Smitty when you ran downstairs to get more water.\"<br> \"Really?\" said Franny suspiciously. \"I didn't hear her yelling or anything.\"<br> \"Oh, she yelled all right,\" boasted Sandy, tossing her balloon onto a gurgling pile of water bombs. \"She said, 'Sandy Anne Hellickson and Frances Hansen--I know that's you up there! You ain't foolin' me! When I tell yer fathers that you was throwin' water bombs off the top of that buildin', yer gonna be sorry you was ever born!'\"<br> The girls doubled up with laughter. They were stationed on the top of the two-story building on Main Street where Franny lived with her parents and two older brothers. With its wooden false front jutting five feet above the roof, the building was practically a skyscraper in their tiny town--if Rusty Nail, Minnesota, could really be described as a \"town\" at all. In reality, it was little more than a bunch of dusty houses and stores clumped together in the middle of nowhere. For miles and miles, a seemingly endless carpet of cornfields surrounded the community. Cows and rust-colored barns dotted the countryside, and tractors drove slowly along the dirt roads.<br> Long ago, Rusty Nail had been a pioneer outpost. But when the winters proved too harsh for the settlers, they took apart their makeshift wooden houses and piled the planks into their creaky covered wagons. No one knows where they went next, and the only thing they left behind was a pile of old bent nails. The next homesteaders who plunked along and settled in the area found these artifacts, and dutifully named the town Rusty Nail in 1879.<br> These days, in 1953, Rusty Nail's countryside was inhabited by weatherworn farmers, with a few store owners and regular folks mixed in. In the middle of the town square stood a sign, dulled by years of exposure to fierce summer thunderstorms and howling winter blizzards. It proclaimed:<br> WELCOME TO RUSTY NAIL!<br> FORMERLY THE AMERICAN COOT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!<br> The American coot was a bird that looked sort of like a duck. Like the pioneers, one year they'd decided to just up and leave. Rumor had it that they found Iowa more to their liking, and as a result, Rusty Nail was left with only the fond memory of the Era of the Coot.<br> The sleepy town had only one of everything: one grocery store, one church, one lawyer, one doctor, one bar, even one old drunk who shambled aimlessly around the town square. There was even only one stoplight, which hung desolately on a thick wire over the intersection of Main Street and Church Street. Sometimes the light worked, and sometimes it didn't. But in any case, most of the townspeople drove their rusted Ford pickup trucks so slowly that it didn't matter one way or another.<br> Time dragged in Rusty Nail and nothing ever seemed to happen. Even the flies in the air seemed to stand still, as though suspended inside honey-colored amber. The slow passing of time showed itself by the rising and falling of the sun, the changing of the seasons, and children growing up and then growing old and replacing&#160;themselves with a new generation of children to grow up and grow old in Rusty Nail.<br> But most of the time, this didn't bother Franny and Sandy. To them, Rusty Nail was the center of the universe. They had been lifelong best friends, for ten whole years. Sandy was the undisputed ringleader, even though she was several months younger than Franny.<br> On this day, the last of summer vacation, Franny and Sandy were playing their favorite game: \"Invasion of the Commies,\" as Russians were popularly known in&#160;those days. Inspired by a war movie the girls had seen at the rather shoddy Hauser's Movie Palace at the end of Main Street, the game involved throwing water balloons at people on the street below, pretending that they were looting-and-pillaging Russian soldiers. Franny and Sandy, of course, pretended to be American soldiers defending their hometown.<br> Only the day before, Sandy had received an extra-large mail shipment of water balloons from the Finkelstein Prank &amp; Curiosity Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This meant that the game could last until well after sunset--provided, of course, that they didn't get caught.<br> Sandy stood on a rickety metal stool, poked her head over the top of the false front, and surveyed the street below. A few farmers in dirty denim&#160;overalls lumped up the sidewalk and disappeared into the Arflot Saddle and Harness Store. The shredded, dirty screen door to Elmer's Bar slapped open, and Old Bill Codger shuffled out, scratching his rear end and blinking dimly in the late-afternoon sun.<br> Suddenly something caught Sandy's attention.<br> \"Oh, goody,\" she said excitedly. \"Stella's on her way up the sidewalk! Quick, pass me that balloon--I mean, that grenade.\"<br> She shoved a handful of cinnamon Red Hots into her mouth as Franny scrambled over with a water bomb. Stella Brunsvold owned the old-fashioned popcorn stand in front of Hauser's. A mean old gossip, she spent her time spitting out corn kernels at children and chasing them away from the theater.<br> \"Here's the grenade, Lieutenant!\" shouted Franny. \"Let 'er rip!\"<br> \"Take that, Comrade!\" Sandy yelled with glee as she tossed the balloon over the edge of the building. Comrade, according to the movies, was what Russians called each other. A few seconds later, the girls heard a satisfying splat! followed by a loud squawk.<br> \"Quick--look and see if you hit her,\" said Franny urgently.<br> \"Dang,\" Sandy said, peeking over the false front. \"I missed Comrade Stella--but I did get the Snurrs.\" An ancient pair of spinsters who ran the five-and-dime store, the Snurr sisters still wore long black pioneer dresses that covered their wrists and ankles.<br> \"They don't count,\" Franny scoffed. \"They walk so slowly that a blind man could hit them.\"<br> \"Fine, if you're such a good shot, then you hit Comrade Stella,\" said Sandy,&#160;tossing Franny a balloon. \"Hey, Franny.\"<br> \"What?\"<br> \"This is a lot more fun than practicin' the piano all day, huh?\"<br> Franny paused. \"Sure,\" she said, since that was clearly what Sandy wanted to hear.<br> &#160;<br><br></p>","flapcopy":"Franny Hansen is a 10-year-old piano prodigy living in Rusty Nail, Minnesota.

Fifteen thousand dollars was an amount to be handled with reverence and respect. As he watched the mounting stack of bills, Hopalong saw them less as the long green bills they were than as the cattle they represented&mdash;the cattle and the work. Into that stack of bills was going money that had grown from days of cold wind and rain, nights of thunder and lightning, of restless herds poised for stampede, of rivers and washes running brim full with roaring flood waters, of dust, blistering sun, and the roar of rustlers&rsquo; guns.<br> &#160;<br> Into that pile so flat and green went more than money. Into that pile went months of brutal labor, the brindle steer that had killed a horse under him down in Lonetree Canyon, and the old mossyhorn who had fouled Lanky&rsquo;s rope on a juniper, putting him three weeks in bed with a broken leg. And into that pile went the kid from Toyah, who had ridden up to join them so full of vitality and exuberance, only to have his horse step into a prairie-dog hole while running ahead of a stampede. They had buried what was left of the kid and sent his hat and gun to a brother in El Paso.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;There she is, Hoppy,&rdquo; the banker said at last. &ldquo;Buck will be mighty glad to get shut of that debt, I know. He&rsquo;s a man who takes bein&rsquo; in debt harder&rsquo;n any man I can think of, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s sure scrimped an&rsquo; cut corners to have that much in three years!&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cassidy agreed, &ldquo;Buck&rsquo;s right conscientious about most things. He don&rsquo;t like to get into debt in the first place, but you know how it was with Dick Jordan. When he fell heir to that ranch out West he sold his cattle an&rsquo; remuda to Buck, knowin&rsquo; if there was one man around he could trust to pay ever&rsquo; last red cent it was Buck.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Came at a good time too. Buck had been talkin&rsquo; about more cattle, an&rsquo; with the additional range he could use, it would be a positive shame not to have &rsquo;em. Otherwise, he never would have gone into debt.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;You takin&rsquo; this money West yourself?&rdquo; The banker&rsquo;s shrewd old eyes studied the silver head. &ldquo;I know Buck can&rsquo;t afford to be away right now.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; it West, an&rsquo; glad of the chance. Old Dick was a friend of mine, too, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve heard a sight about that ranch o&rsquo; his. Rightly, it belonged to his wife. It was part of an old Spanish grant, you know.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Uh-huh. Helped draw up some o&rsquo; the papers. Got a daughter now, I hear.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Had her a long time. Shucks, she was fourteen or fifteen before they left here.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Say&rdquo;&mdash;the banker turned around in his chair&mdash;&ldquo;who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; out there with you?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; alone.

Had his bank held up about three weeks ago, killed his cashier, wounded a deputy sheriff, then lost the durned posse.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Lost &rsquo;em?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Uh-huh, just plain lost &rsquo;em.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> Hopalong slid off the desk and gathered up the money. &ldquo;Well, Buck will be waitin&rsquo; for me, so I&rsquo;d better get into the leather an&rsquo; ride to the ranch. But don&rsquo;t you worry about this money. I&rsquo;ll see it gets to Dick, as promised.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> Tucking the packages of bills into his black shirt and drawing his belt tighter, he hitched his guns into an easier position on his dark-trousered hips and started for the door.<br> &#160;<br> The banker arose from his chair and walked to the window where he could watch Cassidy cross the street. The same trim bowed legs, the broad, sloping shoulders, the lean waist and choppy walk of the horseman. His silver guns were worn by much handling, and his boots were cracked and dusty. Suddenly the banker found himself wishing he was younger and starting West with Hopalong on that ride.<br> &#160;<br> As he started to turn from the window a movement caught his eye, and he hesitated. A man had stepped out from beside the bank and started slowly across the street in Hopalong&rsquo;s wake. If that man had been standing alongside the bank, he might have seen Hopalong take the money, for there was an office window near the desk. The banker frowned. His wife would be waiting supper, and if he got into the saloon he might not get out for hours.&hellip;&#160;Anyway, Hopalong could take care of himself. He always had.<br> &#160;<br> Trouble followed Hopalong Cassidy like wolves follow a snow-driven herd, but few men were more fitted to cope with it than the silver-haired gunfighter. He should have told Hoppy to ook up Monaghan, at the bank in McClellan. Well, he could write to him. Maybe Hoppy would have business over that way.<br> &#160;<br> Dusk was softening the line of the buildings when Hopalong crossed the street to the saloon. A poker game was in session when he pushed through the batwing doors, but the players carefully avoided his eyes. They knew each other, and knew the game was fairly even all around. But Hopalong was a specialist at draw. His brand of poker was apt to be expensive for them, and they wanted none of that.<br> &#160;<br> Three men lounged at the bar, all strangers. One of them, Hoppy remembered, had passed him on the step. His casual glance read their brands with a quick, easy eye, and he grinned to himself. Drifting punchers, maybe a shade on the owl-hoot side.<br> &#160;<br> Trail dust lay thick on their clothes, but their guns had been wiped clean, and the cartridges in their belts shone brightly. One man&mdash;who had passed him on the walk before the saloon&mdash;was a slender young fellow with straight, clean-cut features and a deep line at one corner of his mouth. When he glanced toward Cassidy, Hopalong saw that one eye was half closed by a lowered lid. At first the man seemed to be winking, and then Hoppy realized the affliction was permanent.<br> &#160;<br> The other two also had the look of hard cases. The tall man was round-shouldered and his face carried deep-set lines of cruelty and harshness. The third stranger was scarcely more than a boy, but one already far gone down the hard trails by the look of him.<br> &#160;<br> Drifters were not uncommon, and the range life was not one calculated to make men soft. Such men as these came in and drifted on each morning and night, for Twin Rivers was on a trail much traveled in these months.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Pullin&rsquo; out tomorrow, Hoppy?&rdquo; The bartender leaned his arms on the bar. &ldquo;Johnny was sayin&rsquo; you were headed West to visit Dick Jordan.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> At the name all three strangers turned sharply to stare at Hopalong. Their expressions excited his interest and also their apparent familiarity with the name of Dick Jordan. Only a familiar name could have turned them so sharply. They looked away, and the man with the squint eye spoke to the others in a low, careful voice, as though explaining something.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Cassidy, &ldquo;we bought his herd three years ago. Buck wants me to ride out there, and that country always did appeal to me. It will be good to get shut of this dust and fill my lungs with that good mountain air again.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Dick bought hisself a good ranch, I hear.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t buy it. His wife was Spanish an&rsquo; the ranch was part of an old land grant belonging to her family. She inherited it, so they just moved out there. They took their daughter with them. She was maybe fifteen years old. Nice kid, but all knees and freckles.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> One of the strangers snickered, and Cassidy glanced at them appraisingly. Two of them avoided his eyes, but the one with the bad eyelid met his glance boldly. &ldquo;Heerd what y&rsquo; said about ridin&rsquo; to see Dick Jordan,&rdquo; he commented dryly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if I was you, I&rsquo;d forget it. That there&rsquo;s a tough country for drifters. They don&rsquo;t cotton to &rsquo;em, not none a-tall!&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;That right?&rdquo; Hopalong said carelessly. &ldquo;Well, maybe I can help them get used to it.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> The tall man answered him, and his eyes were hard as he looked at Cassidy. &ldquo;You go out there huntin&rsquo; him,&rdquo; he said insolently, &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re sure likely to find him! You&rsquo;re liable to go right where he is!&rdquo; As he finished speaking he put down his glass and all three walked out of the saloon. On the walk outside one of them spoke, and then all laughed.<br> &#160;<br> Cassidy glanced at the bartender. &ldquo;Know those fellers?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Been around all afternoon,&rdquo; the bartender explained, &ldquo;an&rsquo; takin&rsquo; in a lot of room. The squinty one, he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; his horse shod. Then they&rsquo;re driftin&rsquo; on, headin&rsquo; West.&rdquo;<br> &#160;","flapcopy":"<b>In this first of four classic frontier novels, Louis L'Amour adds his own special  brand to the life and adventures of one of America's favorite fictional cowboys,  Hopalong Cassidy. </b><br><br>In <i>The Rustlers of West Fork,</i> the quick-thinking, fast-shooting  cowpuncher heads west to deliver a fortune in bank notes to his old friend, Dick  Jordan.
